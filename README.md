# python-challenge
module 3 assignment
This challenge made me truly understand the importance of understanding all the tools, where code lives, and being organized. I ran into a lot of issues when I was trying to commit, and I had to take a step back to go follow the proper processes in sequence. I had support in this assignment from asking questions during office hours, tapping in my classmates, and troubleshooting through YouTube and Google.
